# Type Inference of Simple Recursive Functions in Scala


## Setup
Execute `sbt eclipse` to generate eclipse project files, after that it can be imported as a regular eclipse project. 
This action have to be repeated whenever you change dependencies in build.sbt

## Usage
**Compile.scala** contains example how to compile from code with our modified typer.   
**Interpret.scala** runs a REPL with the modified typer.  
Both of them can be run as a regular scala application from IDE or command-line.
